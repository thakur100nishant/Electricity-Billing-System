# Electricity-Billing-System
creating an electricity billing system using Java involves several key components and steps.

Components of the System -

Data Collection:
Meter Reading: Automated meter reading (AMR) or manual entry.
Customer Information: Database of customer details.
Billing Calculation:
Tariff Rates: Different rates based on usage, time of day, etc.
Usage Calculation: Calculate consumption based on meter readings.
Taxes and Fees: Additional charges, if applicable.
Invoicing:
Bill Generation: Create bills for each customer.
Customer Management
Account Management: Create, update, and delete customer accounts.
Payment Tracking: Record payments and update balances.
Reporting:
Usage Reports: Detailed reports on electricity usage.
Financial Reports: Revenue, outstanding payments, etc.
Steps to Develop the System
1. Requirement Analysis
Define all the requirements, such as how data will be collected, what types of billing plans are needed, and how customers will interact with the system.
2. System Design
Architecture: Decide on the architecture (e.g., client-server, web-based).
Database Design: Design the database schema to store all necessary information.
User Interface Design: Design interfaces for users (customers and administrators).
3. Implementation
Database Setup: Create tables for customers, meter readings, billing, payments, etc.
Backend Development: Develop APIs to handle data processing and business logic.
Frontend Development: Create user interfaces for data entry, bill viewing, and payment processing.
4. Testing
Conduct thorough testing to ensure accuracy in calculations and reliability in data handling.
5. Deployment
Deploy the system to a production environment.
Ensure data security and backup processes are in place.

Running the Application -

Set Up the Spring Boot Application
Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE.
Add dependencies for Spring Data JPA, Spring Web, and your chosen database (e.g., MySQL).
Configure the file with your database connection details.
Run the Application
Use the IDE or command line to run the Spring Boot application.
Test the API endpoints using tools like Postman or curl.
